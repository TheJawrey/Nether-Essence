Nether-Essence
==============

The Nether Essence Mod adds a new item and a new block. The item, Nether Essence, is the main point of the mod and it's primary purpose is to craft gunpowder.

Nether Essence is crafted with 6 Netherrack, 2 Soulsand and 1 water bottle or water bucket.

4 Nether Essence can then be crafted with 4 Redstone dust and 1 piece of coal to make gunpowder.

8 Nether Essence can also be crafted together to make a Nether Essence block, which acts as a source of light, although it is not as bright as Glowstone or torches it is still waterproof.

Alternatively both Nether Essence and Nether Essence Blocks can be used as a nether-found fuel source. Nether Essence can smelt 4 blocks and Nether Essence Blocks can smelt 32 blocks.
